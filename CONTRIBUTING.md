# Development docs

## Reporting bugs

Report bugs [here](https://github.com/hanpeki/hanpeki-godot-logger/issues/new).

## Contributing pull requests

If you want to add new engine features, please make sure that:

- This functionality is desired, which means that it solves a common use case that several users will need in their real-life projects.
- You talked to other developers on how to implement it best.
- Even if it doesn't get merged, your PR might still be useful for future work by another developer.

## Developing

Make sure to clone the repo and run the setup script.

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This will prepare the git-hooks required to check your code in the local environment before it goes to CI.
